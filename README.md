```lrc
[00:00.08] Take a step, watch the ground
[00:04.13] Rise to meet your feet somehow
[00:07.98] When all that you are just ain't enough
[00:15.45] The universe will provide
[00:19.43] A guiding hand, a crack of light
[00:23.97] You're too good for giving up
[00:38.47] 
[00:31.37] Imposters and counterfeits
[00:35.25] So-called lowlifes, sound misfits
[00:38.96] Reclaim your shame and dress it up in love
[00:46.56] Tomorrow's waiting down the line
[00:50.65] It's getting late, but there's still time
[00:55.06] You're too good for giving up
[01:09.56] 
[01:02.42] Look how far you've come
[01:06.29] Stronger than the damage done
[01:10.34] Step out of the darkness unafraid
[01:17.75] Remember you belong
[01:22.04] Here as much as anyone
[01:25.98] Even when you're just about to break
[01:43.98] 
[01:33.63] Sitting by a bedside light
[01:37.42] The lonely guard, the unseen night
[01:41.64] Ever further from their God above
[01:49.20] Let your silence make a sound
[01:53.28] All that's lost can still be found
[01:57.47] You're too good for giving up
[02:11.97] 
[02:20.62] Let your silence make a sound
[02:24.53] All that's lost can still be found
[02:28.63] You're too good for giving up
[02:43.13] 
[02:36.01] Look how far you've come
[02:40.00] Stronger than the damage done
[02:43.91] Step out of the darkness unafraid
[02:51.53] Remember you belong
[02:55.67] Here as much as anyone
[02:59.55] Even when you're just about to break
[03:17.55] 
[03:07.42] Take a step, watch the ground
[03:11.22] Rise to meet your feet somehow
[03:15.28] When all that you are just ain't enough
[03:22.79] The universe will provide
[03:26.70] A guiding hand, a crack of light
[03:31.13] You're too good for giving up
[03:38.36] The universe will provide
[03:42.16] A guiding hand, a crack of light
[03:47.09] You're too good for giving up
