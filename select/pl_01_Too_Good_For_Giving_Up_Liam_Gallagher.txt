Take a step, watch the ground
Rise to meet your feet somehow
When all that you are
just ain't enough
The universe will provide
A guiding hand, a crack of light
You're too good for giving up
Imposters and counterfeits
So-called lowlife's and misfits
Reclaim your shame
and dress it up in love
Tomorrow's waiting down the line
It's getting late
but there's still time
You're too good for giving up
Look how far you've come
Stronger than the damage done
Step out of the darkness
unafraid
Remember you belong
Here as much as anyone
Even when you're just about
to break
Sitting by a bedside light
A lonely god, the unseen night
Ever further
from their god above
Let your silence make a sound
All that's lost
can still be found
You're too good for giving up
Let your silence make a sound
All that's lost
can still be found
You're too good for giving up
Look how far you've come
Stronger than the damage done
Step out of the darkness
unafraid
Remember you belong
Here as much as anyone
Even when you're just about
to break
Take a step, watch the ground
Rise to meet your feet somehow
When all that you are
just ain't enough
The universe will provide
A guiding hand, a crack of light
You're too good for giving up
The universe will provide
A guiding hand, a crack of light
You're too good for giving up
